* Task Pirate

** Overview
Task Pirate is a command-line task manager. It rips off Taskwarrior unapologetically but uses Common Lisp. This is what happens when you combine functional programming elitism with task management.

** Features
*** Core
- **Add Tasks**: Create tasks. No frills.
- **Modify Tasks**: Edit tasks. Don’t mess it up.
- **List Tasks**: View tasks. Filter optional, defaults to everything.
- **Persistent State**: JSON storage, because that’s what everyone uses now.

*** CLI
- **Parse Arguments**: Commands like `add`, `modify`, and `list`. Simple, like it should be.
- **Flexible Input**: Take positional and keyword arguments. No excuses.

*** Advanced
- **Tags**: Group things with tags. Works, mostly.
- **Priorities**: Sort tasks. Or don’t.
- **Statuses**: Pending, done, whatever. Track it.
- **Dates**: Universal Time. If you mess this up, it’s on you.

** Architecture
*** Key Components
- **task-manager.lisp**: Does the actual work. Manages tasks, saves, loads.
- **main.lisp**: CLI wrapper. Parses input, delegates to the manager.

*** Libraries
- **Jonathan**: JSON I/O. It works, so we used it.
- **UIOP**: File handling. Because portability isn’t optional.
- **libpyr**: Miscellaneous helpers. Don’t ask.

** Usage
*** Add
```bash
$ ./task-pirate add "Name" "Desc" "High" tag1 tag2
```
Creates a task. If you’re confused, you shouldn’t be here.

*** List
```bash
$ ./task-pirate list
```
Shows tasks. Filters? Optional.

*** Modify
```bash
$ ./task-pirate modify 0 :description "New Desc"
```
Edits task 0. Be precise.

*** Delete
```bash
$ ./task-pirate delete 0
```
Nukes task 0. No confirmation.

** Roadmap
1. **Feature Inflation**:
   - Recurring tasks, because why not.
   - Task dependencies. Maybe.
2. **CLI Bloat**:
   - Add subcommands for filtering. Groan.
   - Improve help. Someone will complain.
3. **Storage Alternatives**:
   - SQLite, cloud. Overkill? Yes.
4. **Tool Integration**:
   - Hook into calendars. Email? Probably.
