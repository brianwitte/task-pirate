Task Pirate
===========

Taskwarrior, Rewritten in Lisp
------------------------------

Task Pirate is a command-line task manager. It rips off Taskwarrior
unapologetically, but uses Common Lisp. This is what happens when you
combine elitism with task management.

Install
-------

   $ make

This builds the binary. Then, move it to a directory in your `PATH`:

   $ mv ./task-pirate /usr/local/bin/

Optionally, alias `task` to `task-pirate` to mimic Taskwarrior:

   $ alias task="task-pirate"

Now, you can use Task Pirate with the same commands you'd use for Taskwarrior.

Usage
-----

Add
~~~

   $ ./task-pirate add "Name" "Desc" "High" tag1 tag2

Creates a task. If you’re confused, you shouldn’t be here.

List
~~~~

   $ ./task-pirate list

Shows tasks. Filters? Optional.

Modify
~~~~~~

   $ ./task-pirate modify 0 :description "New Desc"

Edits task 0. Be precise.

Delete
~~~~~~

   $ ./task-pirate delete 0

Nukes task 0. No confirmation.
